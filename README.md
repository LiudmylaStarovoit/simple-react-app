# People Ops Dashboard

The React + TypeScript dashboard for People Operations teams. It highlights key employee metrics, supports nuanced roster management (filters, drawers, inline edits), and now ships with a fully typed mock API, TanStack Query caching layer, and bundle-aware optimisations. Perfect for portfolio demos or as a foundation for real backend integration.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Typed domain models** (`src/types/employee.ts`) covering employees, filters, stats, and trend points.
- **Mock data layer** (`src/services/employee-service.ts`) with asynchronous CRUD, simulated latency, auto-generated seed data, pagination metadata, and built-in analytics helpers (`src/utils/employee-analytics.ts`).
- **TanStack Query hook** (`src/hooks/use-employees.ts`) orchestrates infinite queries, optimistic mutations (add/delete/toggle/update), and exposes `loadMore` / `refresh` for a real-data feel.
- **Modern UI**: KPI hero, facet filters, search, inline salary editing, archiving drawer, and a lazily loaded Recharts “Team momentum” panel.
- **Bundle-aware build**: manual chunk splitting (React, Query, Recharts) + `React.lazy`/`Suspense` for heavy panels, eliminating the previous Vite size warning.
- **TypeScript-first tooling** with Vitest + Testing Library + happy-dom, ready for CI integration.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Swap the mock service for a real REST/GraphQL backend (or MSW/json-server).
- Expand test coverage (more component cases, Playwright/Cypress for e2e).
- Introduce Storybook + design tokens to document the UI system.
- Set up CI (lint + type-check + test + build) via GitHub Actions.
- Add richer error handling and toast notifications for mutations.
